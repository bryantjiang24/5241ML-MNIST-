# 5241 Project

Project title: Machine Learning and Data Analysis on MNIST Dataset

Project Summary: This project contains three problems of classification, number recognition and number additition. The first problem is solved by different classifiers including KNN, AdaBoost.M1/ C4.5, SVM with Gaussian Kernel. The second problem is solved by neural network structures including Single Hidden Layer Neural Network, CNN, multi-layer CNN on the MNIST dataset. The final accuracy we obtained is over 99.3%. The third problem is solved by Multi-layer CNN with and without Dropout on the given datasets, and we got over 99% accuracy. This project is implemented by TesnorFlow, Keras, Pytorch and several relevant packages in Python.
